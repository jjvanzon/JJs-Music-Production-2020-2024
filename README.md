JJ's Music Production 2021-2024
===============================

Introduction
------------

I have some other songs in mind that might be releasable, though perhaps more difficult to get recorded.


Information
-----------

### Rules

'Rules' pimping Tracker songs from the 90's:

- No new material.
- Reuse and transform existing musical information.
- Use former sample library.

That way I respect what it was,  
will limit how far I go,  
and can be pragmatic finishing things up.

### Lessons Learned

Basics:

- Originality is overrated
- Repetition is fine
- The perfect pattern doesn't exist

Progression / variation:

- Use variations
- Don't be lazy; copy, paste, edit
- Simplify things:
- Build up calmly:
- The instruments
- And tonal/harmonic progression
- Too many things going on at the same time

Feeling:

- Be satisfied
- Don't lead with pride
- Don't fear being mocked
- Abandon a bad idea
- No finetuning till it falls apart

Technique:

- Better samples
- Use (all) expression capabilities
- Be tidy / well organized

Analysis:

- Analyze musical / harmonic content for opportunities to vary
- One complicated loop may contain so much musical information that you might build a whole track around it.
- There are only so many audible frequencies to saturate.

### Pending

3 songs difficult to salvage for now.

- Semi-classical piece
    - Logic Audio sequencer piano + Sound Blaster 64 wave table semi-classical piece
    - [ ] Problem: Logic Audio seems not runnable unless on a Windows 98 machine for instance.
    - [ ] No recording found yet.
- Children song-based counter point composition
    - Logic Audio sequencer Sound Blaster 64 wave table
    - [ ] Problem: Logic Audio seems not runnable unless on a Windows 98 machine for instance.
    - [ ] No recording found yet.
    - [ ] Might make longer.
- MiniDisk-recorded songs
    - MiniDisk song 10: Assignment from that school, but mashed together 2 pieces from me and class mate.
        - Might extract my own portion and mix and record that instead.

Collections yet to inspect (but difficult to salvage for now).

- Other Logic Audio songs:
    - That I may find when inspecting them.
- Other Cubase songs:
    - That I may find when inspecting them.

### Maybe

Some songs I like less, and might be more laborious to make better.

- Roseanna.s3m:
    - Might be nice composition-wise, but perhaps might do better with better sounds.
    - Note 'la' sound might need to be replaced due to 'copyright' concerns.
- Steam.s3m:
    - Might be nice composition-wise, but perhaps might do better with better sounds.


TODO
----

### 2024-05-21 TODO Luister Song: Details

- [ ] .. Drums pitches consistent
- [ ] Missing announcing chord before whistle soft part
- [ ] Start final pattern with a cymbal or something?
- [ ] Metal stereo error sounds good at the beginning of patterns. Use it more?
- [ ] Metal high chords a whole note off?
- [ ] Final part B before sax outtro seems to have violins more quiet. Might want louder.
- [ ] Before whistle intro, ealier note offs, in the pattern before.
- [ ] Counts for end of string intro too.
- [ ] After whistle intro, synth part starts with some unexpected chords. Maybe change a major to a minor at the beginning.
- [ ] Fade-out is a bit dull now
- [ ] First modulation less distance?
- [ ] Tempo slow according to a friend

### 2024-04-14 TODO Luister Song: Expression

- [ ] .. Listing expression possibilities
- [ ] Softer violins at the beginning
- [ ] Echo violin (slow tremolo) accidentally all same volume?
- [ ] More dynamics in the violin chords in the mid-low frequencies?
- [ ] Some volume envelopes use both "Envelope Loop" and "Sustain Loop", which seems strange to me.

Postponed
---------

### 2020-09-17 Postponed Organizing Samples

- [x] Deduplicating samples?
- [x] Sharing sample library on GitHub?
- [ ] See that Git repo for more details.
- [ ] Systematic check of sub-categories' contents?

### 2020-11-25 Postponed Adapting Song "Sad Organ Shorter Version"

- [x] Volume maximization. Factor = 3.79
- [x] Experimenting with pitch shift and mix to see if harsher tones might be relieved.
- [ ] It is my opinion that it might not be due to the lack of harmonics, but perhaps some volume curves might be more effective.

Done

### 2020-09-05 Done MiniDisk-Recorded Songs Inspection

(Blue MiniDisk)

Salvage them all either way?

- ~~MiniDisk song 1-5: Tracker songs I already released / could record another way.~~
- MiniDisk song 6? Wave table song. Not my favorite, but some one else might like it.
- MiniDisk song 7: Oboes. Classic-ish. Add some some repetition?
- ~~MiniDisk song 8: Same but flutes. Not better in my opinion.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 9: Repetitious. Not my favorite. Bit repetitious and never stopping sound wall.~~
- MiniDisk song 10: Assignment from that school, but mashed together 2 pieces from me and class mate.
- ~~MiniDisk song 11: Funeral March from Chopin. Not me playing I think.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 12: Some Hungarian folk song woman singing.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 13: Pitch-followed 'copy' of that Hungarian woman.~~
- MiniDisk song 14: Blues piano (me) + wave table. Not my favorite. May include?
- MiniDisk song 15: Short, but sweet?
- ~~MiniDisk song 16: Not mine. Some sort of vintage jazz.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 18: Nice ethnic song with violin. Not mine.~~
- MiniDisk song 19 = 'ashtray' song
- MiniDisk song 20 = sad organ counterpoint, shorter
- MiniDisk song 21 = nicer sort of funky counterpoint? Make x2 longer?
- MiniDisk song 22 + 23 + 24 = sad organ counter point, different version, in parts for some reason, ends with theme.

### 2020-09-08 Done CD Recording Inspection

- The 'blue' CD: general impression: 3 songs I already have, 1 song I might not want.
- Still to inspect the other CD, which I think is just the result of the project "The CD 2005".
    - Indeed but:
    - Track 22 might be usable.
    - Track 27 might be usable.

### 2020-09-08 Done FastTracker 2 Orientation

- [x] Downloaded FastTracker
- [x] Configure and orient.
- [x] It does not seem stereo.
- [x] I think I found a disk recording option.
- [x] Using Impulse Tracker / Schism Tracker for .XM files is also an option.

### 2020-09-08 Done Adapting Song "Luister.xm"

- [x] Perhaps change saxophone to oboe or horn
- [x] Perhaps just in some sections.
- [x] Difficulty navigating/playing samples. \> Sample library partly reorganized now.
- [x] Impulse Tracker seems to list max 650 sample files instead of around 2000.
- [x] Google Drive is not happy with my accidental folder move or something.
- [x] ~~Might split up sample files into a folder a letter. (Rigorous categorization might go a tad far for now.)~~

### 2020-09-20 Done Categorizing Samples Based on Sound and then Name Pattern

- [x] Obs: Windows File Explorer shows different sorting as Impulse Tracker.
- [x] Problem: I have difficulty sorting categorizing groups of samples that way.
- [x] ~~Alternative: Finding a rename function in Impulse Tracker?~~
- [x] ~~Alternative: Making due with rougher categorizations?~~
- [x] ~~Alternative: Finding a program that might sort the file names the same as in Windows File Explorer?~~
- [x] Alternative:
    - [x] Improvisingly playing samples in Impulse Tracker for a hint of the type of instrument vs file pattern.
    - [x] Moving files with pattern to a separate folder.
    - [x] Listening the files.
    - [x] Moving files to category folder.

### 2020-09-13 Done Ideas Recording MiniDisk to PC

- [x] I accepted that analog audio ports might be the only way I see right now.
- [x] ~~Maybe updating the audio driver of the laptop worked as in maybe now the laptop will recognize audio is input, instead of insisting it is output.~~
- [x] ~~Alternatively, the old big PC audio card might work if I move cards around in it internally.~~
- [x] Otherwise I might wait until I may have built a new big PC, which might have audio ports that actually work.

### 2020-09-17 Done Organizing Samples

I would like to change the folder structure of the samples, because DosBox/Impulse Tracker does not seem to show folders with more than about 650 files. If categorization would be in the cards, that might be a nice result too.

- [x] I would like to merge copies of copies together to one folder.
- [x] I may want to keep existing categorizations where applicable.
- [x] Or split into a folder per letter
- [x] Changing existing categories?
    - [x] Names in English?
    - [x] Singular mostly?
    - [x] Removing empty folders?
    - [x] Less hierarchy?
- [x] Categorizing more based on name
- [x] Categorizing samples based on sound and then name pattern
- [x] Categorizing samples listening individual sounds (about 100 remain)
- [x] Categorizing remaining samples
    - Most seem hard to play in the software I used, because they seem either 16 bit or Fast Tracker files.
    - Since now most samples have at least a main categorization, it might be worth taking care of that remainder to complete it.
- [x] Sub-categorizing samples
    - [x] EFFECTS
    - [x] ELECTRNC
    - [x] PERCUS
    - [x] STRING
    - [x] WIND
    - [x] Samples that may have remained on the main category level, I might not be sure about what it is.
- [x] Fine-tuning categorization?
    - [x] ~~"ELECTRFX" => "BEEPFX"~~
    - [x] "INDUSTRY" => "MECHANIC"
    - [x] ~~"PARTY" => "FUNNY"~~
    - [x] "BEEP" => "SYNBEEP"
    - [x] ~~"LONGBASS" => "SYNBASTR" or "SYNBASLN"?~~
    - [x] "DIG" => "GENERATD"
    - [x] "GEN" => "GENERATD"
    - [x] Spreading content over SYNBEEP and ELECTRFX
    - [x] Moving some of the CYMBAL content to CRASH or HIHAT

### 2020-11-20 Done Adapting Song "Not My Favorite Wave Table Song"

- [x] Maximizing volume
- [x] Volume factor: 1.2
- [x] Using Audacity Adjustable Fade

### 2020-11-25 Done Adapting Song "Blues Piano 1"

- [x] Volume Maximization

### 2020-11-25 Done Adapting Song "Blues Piano 2"

- [x] Maximizing volume. Coefficient = 2.38

### 2024-04-01 Done Details Adapting Song "Luister.xm"

- [x] Cymbal volume swing
- [x] 2nd repeat with synth lead, low string hung.
- [x] 1 announcing chord was bairly audible.
- [x] ~~Why are a stretch of violin legato channels all left channel in one case? For echo effect?~~ \> Yes
- [x] Pattern 4: Violin Full persistent chord may not match the 2nd chord. Ended other 2 notes there. Only kept base note and even increased volume there.
- [x] Fix Whistle's buggy envelopes 
- [x] Finetuning Sax envelopes so it'll cut through the mix.
- [x] Pattern 7: Gem stops whistle \> Earlier tweaking fixed it.
- [x] Gave Gem chord some stereo.
- [x] Drums: Disabling envelopes, continue upon new note.
- [x] Revert Whistle envelope back to original minus error.
- [x] Revert some more envelopes back, because it didn't make it sound better.
- [x] Extend final chord (using part B's 'Legato Violin', which is actually a slow tremolo tremolo rhythm: loop and fade it out.)
- [x] Middle violin echo had panning set, that was later overwritten by 0. \> Yeah, that actually sounded more spacious.
- [x] End fade:
    - [x] Merge last chord with end fade somehow.
    - [x] Use more channels for that.
    - [x] Fade out quicker
- [x] Middle violins more dynamics > Only slight volume swing.
- [x] Timing of the 1st announcing arpeggio chord.
- [x] Fade out quicker and richer.
- [x] ~~2nd sax note's volume bothers me.~~ \> Omit against perfectionism

### 2024-04-12 Done Luister Song: Horizontal Build Up

- [x] Do a pattern with chords just base notes or fifth interval?
- [x] And less notes? (Horizontal build up / out-of-scope?)

### 2024-04-07 Done Luister Song: Vertical Build-Up

- [x] I think maybe it is a lot of musical information in one blow.
- [x] But how to dose it better?
- [x] Investigate nice combos of instrumentation
    - [x] Strings
    - [x] Strings + bass
    - [x] Strings + bass + metal
    - [x] Strings + bass + whistle
    - [x] Strings + bass + synth
    - [x] Strings + metal + whistle + bass
    - [x] Strings + bass echo + metal
    - [x] ~~Strings + bass echo + metal + hihat~~
    - [x] ~~Strings + metal + whistle~~
    - [x] ~~Stringy parts of 3rd out of 4 synth variations~~ \> Can't find a place for it.
- [x] Build up:
    - [x] Build up 1st part tonal parts
    - [x] Build up 1st part drums
    - [x] Forget about having the entire synth melody at the beginning.
    - [x] ~~Merge announcing part (pattern 9) with drum build-up (pattern 20)~~ \> Would only add announcing chord.
    - [x] Quietly build up 2nd part
    - [x] Transition to original sequence
    - [x] Do original sequence
    - [x] Sax + violins 
        - [x] Maybe at the end mixed with pattern 11
    - [x] Break down
    - [x] Experimenting with pattern order
    - [x] Using whistle too soon is weird.
    - [x] Hard synth patterns at the beginning going over into more complex variation sooner?
    - [x] Break down: first louder one, then one of the quieter ones. 
    - [x] Proper fading at the end.
    - [x] ~~Last transition from loud synth part to loud whistle part is 'weird' perhaps use original synth pattern's 3rd variation.~~ \> Everything changed. Not sure what this applies to anymore.
    - [x] Announcing chords in all the right places.
    - [x] Strange beeps in end fade
    - [x] Latest synth melody alternative: Use different chord notes in end?
    - [x] ~~Restore most of original order in the middle.~~ \> Too repetitious.
    - [x] ~ After sax solo there might be room for more?
    - [x] Latest synth melody alternative: Change announcing arpeggio chord a bit?

### 2024-04-07 Done Luister Song: Details

- [x] Violin intro: shorter
- [x] Violin intro: off-beat 2nd half
- [x] Whistle intro: use higher notes again for better connection violin intro.
- [x] Synth intro: Avoid modulation (by transposing previous patterns)
- [x] Drum build up: Remove metal part
- [x] Synth intro: Less boring melody
- [x] ~ Panning envelopes at a speed on the beat (phone speakers made it sound like tremolos)
- [x] Last pattern twice? Fade out a little quicker.
- [x] Beeps at the end fade are back. Fix channel panning again.
- [x] Synth little more quiet in its 2nd intro pattern?
- [x] Synth channel volumes might mess up in the beginning.
- [x] Drums: Fix hihat where it had much lower pitch.
- [x] Drums: Remove 2nd crash at end of patterns
