Songs (and Tasks/Requirements)
------------------------------

14 songs selected in total.

### MiniDisk

- [x] Not My Favorite Wave Table Song
    - But some one else might like it.
    - MiniDisk song __6__
    - 'Blue' CD song 2
    - Wave table song.
- [ ] Oboes
    - Classic-ish
    - MiniDisk song __7__
    - [ ] Add some some repetition?
- [x] Blues Piano 1
    - Me on piano + wave table
    - MiniDisk song __14__
    - Not my favorite. May include anyway.
    - [ ] High amplification factor. Might re-record.
- [ ] Short But Sweet
    - MiniDisk song __15__
    - [ ] Make 2x longer?
- [x] Blues Piano 2
    - Me on piano + wave table
    - MiniDisk song __16__
    - [ ] High amplification factor. Might re-record.
- [ ] 'Ashtray Song'
    - Sound scape
    - MiniDisk song __19__
    - [ ] Has sharp tones. Remedied perhaps if mixed with effect-free version.
- [ ] Sad Organ
    - Counterpoint composition
    - Made using Logic Audio sequencer and Sound Blaster 64 wave table
    - [ ] MiniDisk song __20__ = shorter
    - [ ] MiniDisk song __22__ + __23__ + __24__ = longer version, in parts for some reason, ends with theme. A bit long.
    - Perhaps publish do both.
    - [ ] High amplification factor. Might re-record.
    - [ ] Tones seem harsh. Perhaps effect creating more harmonics. Exciter effect?
    - [ ] Perhaps make give longer notes a volume envelope for subtlety vs harshness.
- [ ] Funky Counterpoint
    - MiniDisk song __21__
    - Nicer sort of funky counterpoint.
    - [ ] Make 2x longer?

### Impulse Tracker

- [ ] 'Rock' tracker song
    - [x] It seems there are 2 variations.
    - [x] May use EXAM2.IT but slower
    - [ ] Take some inspiration from ROKZAWEL.IT ?
    - [ ] Echo at the end ?
- [ ] Zielig.IT
    - [ ] Make longer?
- [ ] Realgene.s3m
    - [ ] With some changes?
- [ ] Oldm007r.IT
    - "The CD 2005" track 22?
    - Composition-wise not special, sounds might make up for it?
- [ ] Tryout7.IT
    - "The CD 2005" track 27
    - Not superb, but good enough?

### Fast Tracker

- [ ] LUISTER2.XM
    - [x] Partially replaced sax
    - [x] Mixing
    - [x] Cleaner envelopes
    - [x] Effect chords at announcing moments
    - [x] Cymbal volume swing
    - [x] 2nd repeat with synth lead, low string hung.
    - [x] 1 announcing chord was bairly audible.
    - [x] ~~Why are a stretch of violin legato channels all left channel in one case? For echo effect?~~ \> Yes
    - [x] Pattern 4: Violin Full persistent chord may not match the 2nd chord. Ended other 2 notes there. Only kept base note and even increased volume there.
    - [x] Fix Whistle's buggy envelopes 
    - [ ] Pattern 7: Gem stops whistle
    - [ ] Finetuning Sax envelopes so it'll cut through the mix.
    - [ ] Extend final chord
    - [ ] Vertical build-up? Many opportunities? Can of worms?

### Pending

3 songs difficult to salvage for now.

- Semi-classical piece
    - Logic Audio sequencer piano + Sound Blaster 64 wave table semi-classical piece
    - [ ] Problem: Logic Audio seems not runnable unless on a Windows 98 machine for instance.
    - [ ] No recording found yet.
- Children song-based counter point composition
    - Logic Audio sequencer Sound Blaster 64 wave table
    - [ ] Problem: Logic Audio seems not runnable unless on a Windows 98 machine for instance.
    - [ ] No recording found yet.
    - [ ] Might make longer.
- MiniDisk-recorded songs
    - MiniDisk song 10: Assignment from that school, but mashed together 2 pieces from me and class mate.
        - Might extract my own portion and mix and record that instead.

Collections yet to inspect (but difficult to salvage for now).

- Other Logic Audio songs:
    - That I may find when inspecting them.
- Other Cubase songs:
    - That I may find when inspecting them.

### Maybe

Some songs I like less, and might be more laborious to make better.

- Roseanna.s3m:
    - Might be nice composition-wise, but perhaps might do better with better sounds.
    - Note 'la' sound might need to be replaced due to 'copyright' concerns.
- Steam.s3m:
    - Might be nice composition-wise, but perhaps might do better with better sounds.

TODO
----

### 2020-11-25 TODO Adapting Song "Sad Organ Shorter Version"

- [x] Volume maximization. Factor = 3.79
- [x] Experimenting with pitch shift and mix to see if harsher tones might be relieved.
- [ ] It is my opinion that it might not be due to the lack of harmonics, but perhaps some volume curves might be more effective.

### 2020-09-08 TODO Adapting Song "Luister.xm"

- [ ] Perhaps record the original song file to wav/raw?
- [ ] Perhaps change saxophone to oboe or horn
- [ ] Perhaps just in some sections.
- [ ] Difficulty navigating/playing samples.
- [ ] Impulse Tracker seems to list max 650 sample files instead of around 2000.
- [x] Google Drive is not happy with my accidental folder move or something.
- [ ] Might split up sample files into a folder a letter. (Rigorous categorization might go a tad far for now.)


Postponed
---------

### 2020-09-17 Postponed Organizing Samples

- [ ] Deduplicating samples?
- [ ] Systematic check of sub-categories' contents?
- [ ] Sharing sample library on GitHub?

### 2020-09-08 Postponed FastTracker 2 Orientation

- [ ] I think I found a disk recording option.


Done
----

### 2020-09-05 Done MiniDisk-Recorded Songs Inspection

(Blue MiniDisk)

Salvage them all either way?

- ~~MiniDisk song 1-5: Tracker songs I already released / could record another way.~~
- MiniDisk song 6? Wave table song. Not my favorite, but some one else might like it.
- MiniDisk song 7: Oboes. Classic-ish. Add some some repetition?
- ~~MiniDisk song 8: Same but flutes. Not better in my opinion.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 9: Repetitious. Not my favorite. Bit repetitious and never stopping sound wall.~~
- MiniDisk song 10: Assignment from that school, but mashed together 2 pieces from me and class mate.
- ~~MiniDisk song 11: Funeral March from Chopin. Not me playing I think.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 12: Some Hungarian folk song woman singing.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 13: Pitch-followed 'copy' of that Hungarian woman.~~
- MiniDisk song 14: Blues piano (me) + wave table. Not my favorite. May include?
- MiniDisk song 15: Short, but sweet?
- ~~MiniDisk song 16: Not mine. Some sort of vintage jazz.~~
- ~~MiniDisk song 18: Nice ethnic song with violin. Not mine.~~
- MiniDisk song 19 = 'ashtray' song
- MiniDisk song 20 = sad organ counterpoint, shorter
- MiniDisk song 21 = nicer sort of funky counterpoint? Make x2 longer?
- MiniDisk song 22 + 23 + 24 = sad organ counter point, different version, in parts for some reason, ends with theme.

### 2020-09-08 Done CD Recording Inspection

- The 'blue' CD: general impression: 3 songs I already have, 1 song I might not want.
- Still to inspect the other CD, which I think is just the result of the project "The CD 2005".
    - Indeed but:
    - Track 22 might be usable.
    - Track 27 might be usable.

### 2020-09-08 Done FastTracker 2 Orientation

- [x] Downloaded FastTracker
- [x] Configure and orient.
- [x] It does not seem stereo.

### 2020-09-20 Done Categorizing Samples Based on Sound and then Name Pattern

- [x] Obs: Windows File Explorer shows different sorting as Impulse Tracker.
- [x] Problem: I have difficulty sorting categorizing groups of samples that way.
- [x] ~~Alternative: Finding a rename function in Impulse Tracker?~~
- [x] ~~Alternative: Making due with rougher categorizations?~~
- [x] ~~Alternative: Finding a program that might sort the file names the same as in Windows File Explorer?~~
- [x] Alternative:
    - [x] Improvisingly playing samples in Impulse Tracker for a hint of the type of instrument vs file pattern.
    - [x] Moving files with pattern to a separate folder.
    - [x] Listening the files.
    - [x] Moving files to category folder.

### 2020-09-13 Done Ideas Recording MiniDisk to PC

- [x] I accepted that analog audio ports might be the only way I see right now.
- [x] ~~Maybe updating the audio driver of the laptop worked as in maybe now the laptop will recognize audio is input, instead of insisting it is output.~~
- [x] ~~Alternatively, the old big PC audio card might work if I move cards around in it internally.~~
- [x] Otherwise I might wait until I may have built a new big PC, which might have audio ports that actually work.

### 2020-09-17 Done Organizing Samples

I would like to change the folder structure of the samples, because DosBox/Impulse Tracker does not seem to show folders with more than about 650 files. If categorization would be in the cards, that might be a nice result too.

- [x] I would like to merge copies of copies together to one folder.
- [x] I may want to keep existing categorizations where applicable.
- [x] Or split into a folder per letter
- [x] Changing existing categories?
    - [x] Names in English?
    - [x] Singular mostly?
    - [x] Removing empty folders?
    - [x] Less hierarchy?
- [x] Categorizing more based on name
- [x] Categorizing samples based on sound and then name pattern
- [x] Categorizing samples listening individual sounds (about 100 remain)
- [x] Categorizing remaining samples
    - Most seem hard to play in the software I used, because they seem either 16 bit or Fast Tracker files.
    - Since now most samples have at least a main categorization, it might be worth taking care of that remainder to complete it.
- [x] Sub-categorizing samples
    - [x] EFFECTS
    - [x] ELECTRNC
    - [x] PERCUS
    - [x] STRING
    - [x] WIND
    - [x] Samples that may have remained on the main category level, I might not be sure about what it is.
- [x] Fine-tuning categorization?
    - [x] ~~"ELECTRFX" => "BEEPFX"~~
    - [x] "INDUSTRY" => "MECHANIC"
    - [x] ~~"PARTY" => "FUNNY"~~
    - [x] "BEEP" => "SYNBEEP"
    - [x] ~~"LONGBASS" => "SYNBASTR" or "SYNBASLN"?~~
    - [x] "DIG" => "GENERATD"
    - [x] "GEN" => "GENERATD"
    - [x] Spreading content over SYNBEEP and ELECTRFX
    - [x] Moving some of the CYMBAL content to CRASH or HIHAT

### 2020-11-20 Done Adapting Song "Not My Favorite Wave Table Song"

- [x] Maximizing volume
- [x] Volume factor: 1.2
- [x] Using Audacity Adjustable Fade

### 2020-11-25 Done Adapting Song "Blues Piano 1"

- [x] Volume Maximization
- [x] Factor: 2.18

### 2020-11-25 Done Adapting Song "Blues Piano 2"

- [x] Maximizing volume. Coefficient = 2.38
